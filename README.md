**Score Hider** is a browser extension which hides "user approval scores" (e.g.
likes, votes, awards) on several websites. It currently supports:

* Twitter
* Reddit (redesign and old)
* YouTube comments

Why would you want this? There's no particular reason in mind, but some answers
might be:

* you think existing scores overly affect how you judge posts
* you worry about the scores you receive on your own posts
* you want to see what using "social media" feels like without scores
